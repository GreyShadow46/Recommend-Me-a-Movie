This is a movie recommendation website I made as part of a final year project. The website is viewable on mobile and desktop. A brief description of the website is provided on the first page. I am working on making the website https secure but in the meantime any passwords used are encrypted. If you are still uncomfortable sharing your real password any will work. If the website is down it will likely be for testing reasons message me on LinkedIn or callumchavez89@gmail.com and I'll make it accessible for you.
