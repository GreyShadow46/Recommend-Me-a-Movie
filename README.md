This is a movie recommendation website I made as part of a final year project. The website is viewable on mobile and desktop. The desktop styles may not be ideal because of the switch to mobile support. Additionally, the mobile site cannot view images of the recommendations for an unknown reason. Furthermore while the country switching function to the us or australia works I am in the process of properly populating the database with this data so please do not try this currently. These issues are being worked on. The link to the wbsite is http://ec2-13-41-200-144.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/
